# psush

Psush, is minimal shell program I completed in my operating systems class. It takes in user commands and utilizes a number of operating system calls to execute those commands. It can also run other programs/commands installed on your system, pipe I/O between commands, and redirect I/O of files.

## Installation

1. Download
2. Compile source files using __make__ 
3. Run the program using ./psush

You should then be prompted with the default prompt
```bash
current-user β:
```
## Usage

```bash
alyaj β: echo hello world
hello world
alyaj β:  
```
```bash
alyaj β: vim main.c
```

## Built-in Commands
cd 

cwd

history

echo

quit
